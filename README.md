## About

This website has been designed and implemented by Benjamin Waddell, Cody Jacob, and Martin Sawicki as part of the 
[Bachelor of Applied Information Systems Technology](http://www.nait.ca/program_home_78547.htm) capstone 
program at the <a href="http://www.nait.ca/">Northern Alberta Institute of Technology</a>, on behalf of the 
<a href="http://performancescience.ac.uk/">Centre for Performance Science</a>. Its purpose is to allow an audience 
to provide live feedback during an event, which can range from dramatic acting to product demonstrations.

Below you will find guides demonstrating the operation of the various services this website provides. If you would 
like to provide feedback or report a issue, please send an email to: <a href="mailto:continuinait@gmail.com">ContinuiNait@gmail.com</a>

## Joining an Event
To join an event, obtain the event key from the event facilitator and enter it into the text box on the homepage. 
Click the join event button, and if the event key is correct, you will enter the event room. If you entered the
event key incorrectly, an error message will appear.  

## Evaluating an Event
In the event room you will see two large arrows, one blue, the other red, as well as a number in the centre of the
screen, your current rating. Tapping the blue arrow will increase your rating by one, and tapping the red arrow will
decrease it by one. If the event has not begun or has ended, tapping one of the arrows will display a message to
inform you of the events status.

## Creating an Account
If you wish to host your own events and gain live feedback, you must create a facilitator account. This can 
be done by clicking Register in the top right corner of the page, beside the Login button. You will be redirected
to the Create Account page, where you will need to fill in the required fields, such as your email and a password. If
your account was made successfully, you will be redirected to the homepage, with two new options in the top left of
the page, View Account and Events.


## Viewing your Account
If you wish to update your account information or your password, click on My Account on the left side of the navigation 
bar. Here you can modify the contents of your account or password as you please. If any errors or empty fields exist 
when you attempt to change your information, the page will notify you and not proceed with the update.

## Creating an Event
To create an event for evaluation, click the Create New Event button on the home page. This will take you to the Create
Event page. Here you will enter he event information and event date. Once this is done, hit the Create Event button. If
successful, you will be automatically redirected to the view event page for your new event. Otherwise, you will be 
notified if an error occurred. 

NOTE: If you are not logged in, you will be redirected to the Create account page when clicking Create Event.

## Viewing an Event
When you wish to view an event, click on My Events on the left side of the navigation bar. This will load and display 
a list of all your events, past, present, and future, for you to choose from. When you identify the event you wish to 
view, hit the View Event button associated with that event. You will be redirected to the event page for the selected
event, where you can view the basic event details, the average event score, the event evaluators and their scores,
and the overall event stats once the event is ended.

To begin an event, click the Begin Event button, and all the evaluators will be able to begin providing feedback.
Likewise, to end the event click, click on the End Event button. Upon doing so, more in-depth data will be generated,
and the evaluators will be unable to provide more feedback. To download a copy of the event details yourself, click
on Export Event Data. This will prompt you to choose a name and location to save your event data, which can then be
opened and viewed at a later date.
